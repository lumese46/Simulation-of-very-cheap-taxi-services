# Simulation-of-very-cheap-taxi-services

I utilized java to develop a simulation for Qnq’s cheap taxi service, using directed graphs and dijkstra’s
algorithm. Java’s object-oriented features enabled me to model the routes and taxi service components
effectively. The use of Dijkstra’s algorithm enabled me to determine the shortest paths and find the
nearest taxi to take a client to the to the nearest QnQ shop thus leading to an optimal solution. Overall,
this project allowed me to further strengthen my skills in java programming, algorithm design and
problem-solving.
